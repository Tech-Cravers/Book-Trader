# Book-Trader
The Book Trader Website deals with the fact that many of the students are not able to purchase a full edition of books that are either :
● Costlier than regular books,
● Not available to the students due to shortage in the region by the publications.
They can use our webpage to get access to the books for some time without any need for payment, Instead they have to upload other books which will be in the form of a scanned pdf.
